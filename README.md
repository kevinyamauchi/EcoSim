# EcoSim
Python implementation of the Edge Effect ecology simulation project

	- Can initialize a randomly populated grid of arbitrary size and total population
	- Displays ecosystem each timestep
	- Individuals move, but do not interact with eachother

	v00: created the class with a simple movement rule: one individual moves right with each timestep. More complex motion and interaction to come...
